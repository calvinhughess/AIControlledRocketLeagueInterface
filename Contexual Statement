In creating the AI-Controlled Rocket League Interface, I combined my passion for gaming, especially Rocket League, 
with my interest in artificial intelligence and computer vision. This project involved developing a script to 
automate car control in the game. To accurately track the car, I used a green gradient mask, and the script 
included both automated and manual controls for different gameplay scenarios. The project required the use of 
several technologies like OpenCV, pyautogui, and Python, showcasing my programming skills and my ability to solve 
problems in a challenging and dynamic environment. 

This interface is an important part of my portfolio because it demonstrates my commitment to learning new 
technologies and my interest in the possibilities of AI in gaming. It's a practical example of how I combine my
personal interests with my technical skills, reflecting my journey in the fields of AI and computer science.
Working on this project taught me about the importance of precision in AI, especially in unpredictable 
environments like games, and the need for clear, user-friendly documentation, which is evident in the 
detailed README file I created. Overall, this AI-Controlled Rocket League Interface is a strong representation 
of my ability to manage complex projects, push the limits of AI applications, and my passion for creating 
innovative and engaging technology solutions.
